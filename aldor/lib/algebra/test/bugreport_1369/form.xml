wrong arithmetic for distributed multivariate polynomials with degree anticompatible orderings
</subject>
<description>
The Algebra reference only states that orderings for exponent vectors have to be compatible with the monoid operation. This is reasonable and allows for non-noetherian orderings (which I desperately need). But the Type 'DistributedMultivariatePolynomial{0|1}' implements some shortcuts for faster arithmetic that assume that '1' is the smallest exponent possible. I found two such shortcuts: In '*' of 'DistributedMultivariatePolynomial1' and in 'ground?' of 'DistributedMultivariatePolynomial0'. But probably there are more places, that would have to be changed. (Because I recompiled the library with those two places modified and afterwards I got different arithmetic errors.) The bug can only be observed when linking to the debug-libraries, otherwise one even gets a segmentation fault at execution time. I marked the bug as critical, because it is critical for me: I'm preparing a presentation for the Aldor workshop in Santander and I cannot go on without this bug beeing fixed. Please help soon.
