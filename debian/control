Description: Aldor compiler and libraries
 The Aldor Programming Language is the successor of A# as the extension
 language of the Axiom computer algebra system.
 .
 The Aldor language combines imperative, functional, and object-oriented
 features. It has an elaborate dependent type system, allowing types to be used
 as first-class values. Aldor's syntax is heavily influenced by Pascal, but it
 is optionally indentation-sensitive, like Python. In its current
 implementation, it is compiled, but an interactive listener is provided.
